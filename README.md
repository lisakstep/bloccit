## Bloccit: a Reddit clone to teach the fundamentals of web development and Rails 4.

You can see the functional version called lkstephens-bloccit on [Heroku](https://lkstephens-bloccit.herokuapp.com/ "Lisa's Bloccit")

Made with my mentor Xander Miller at [Bloc](http://bloc.io).

###Setup
Please note I use a config/application.yml file. Please refer to the template config/application.example.yml for the items contained within my actual .yml file.
